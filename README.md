homebrew-grc
============

Fork of official grc formula


Background
----------

`brew install grc` fails because the Generic Colouriser`s site is down. This formula uses a mirror provided by pengwynn.


Usage
-----

The original formula mxcl/master/grc cannot be overwritten, so to install a this version you can use an extended syntax:

    brew install https://raw.github.com/sabril/homebrew-grc/master/Formula/grc.rb
